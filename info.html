    <h1>Game of Life with Directed Critters</h1>
    <p>This interactive implementation of Conway's Game of Life features critters that move around the grid and "poop" random groups of live cells. The simulation runs in your web browser using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</p>
    <h2>How to Use</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To draw critters on the grid, press and hold the left mouse button.</li>
        <li>To draw tiles on the grid, press and hold the right mouse button.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>About the Game of Life</h2>
    <p>The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.</p>
